## Description

This is my first Ruby on Rails application. Currently studying at [Coder Academy](https://coderacademy.edu.au) and we were tasked with building a 2-way marketplace application and were given 10 days to complete this piece of assessment. This application is intended to be used by Learner Drivers and Instructors. Where a learner driver is able to book a lesson with an instructor and then are able to see that lesson in their 'my lessons' tab. Instructors and Admin roles can book lessons for students as well. Both instructors and students can see all of the upcoming and their past lessons for reference. 

This application is the MVP for a full-fledged marketplace.

## Motivation and Inspiration

In the past one of my professions was a driver trainer. I worked as a contractor with a company, but as contractor's are able to work for any company, which means that if that instructor had available time, they could also put that up on this site and be able to conduct individual lessons outside of their current company.

A platform like this could actually exist in today's society and I intend to develop this idea further. I originally had built a page driving lesson booking system for my company with JavaScript and Firebase. So my inspiration for design came from this app. I cannot post a link to that app due to the database not being properly secured yet, which only contains fake data in development.
