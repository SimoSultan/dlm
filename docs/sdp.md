## Statement of Purpose

The goal was to develop a terminal application that resembles someone learning to code. A re-imagining of the experiences that programmers will face in a learning environment to some small degree. The game must provide challenges, fun, laughs, but most importantly, reiterate the values of Growth Mindset. The game is inspired from, more-or-less, every episode of the TV show Scrubs. This show provided challenges to the main character and laughs along the way, but majority of episodes, there was always something the main character learnt, a life lesson for example, which is what I hoped to encapsulate.

Finishing the game is when you have enough EXP to be able to look for a job, or depending on what you did through your journey, you may receive a job offer.

The problem I hoped to solve with my choice of a text adventure game, apart from the main concept of enjoyment, was to use the life lesson of having the user see the value of helping others. Because, not only do they get experience if they choose to, but they get to help another person along the way. I believe I managed to scratch the surface of this goal in the time frame provided. 

The audience for the game is mainly tailored towards a programmer. As the type of questions that are presented to the user throughout the game are coding based, so for a non-programmer, these would be quite difficult, still possible, but a lot more time consuming. This game is also specifically tailored towards a programmer who is in the learning stages. We are all always learning, but a new programmer is someone who faces these types of challenges every day, and these users will receive the most enjoyment for the game.

I had never developed a game myself which is why I chose to undertake my first one as a text adventure, which seemed appropriate for a terminal app as well. Putting enjoyment at the front of design (apart from UI) was a challenge I enjoyed. Also combining all the topics I had learnt so far into one coherent design, one helluva fun time.

## Motivation and Inspiration

In the past one of my professions was a driver trainer. I worked as a contractor with a company, but as contractor's are able to work for any company, which means that if that instructor had available time, they could also put that up on this site and be able to conduct individual lessons outside of their current company.

A platform like this could actually exist in today's society and I intend to develop this idea further. I originally had built a page driving lesson booking system for my company with JavaScript and Firebase. So my inspiration for design came from this app. I cannot post a link to that app due to the database not being properly secured yet, which only contains fake data in development.

## Tech Stack

- Ruby
- Rails 6+
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- JavaScript and 
- PostgreSQL
- Git
- Bootstrap 4
- Heroku

Ruby on Rails was the foundation of this application which uses all of the above languages. There was additional JS written to implement the Google Maps Places API address autocomplete select box. Bootstrap was used for the front-end framework to style elements. PostgreSQL for the database. Git and GitHub for version control and Heroku for deployment.

> ### Trello Board 

The project management application used to complete these tasks was Trello. This program allowed me to develop outlines for the majority of the application, including features, methods, timelines and so forth. Without this plan, implementing the application would have been significantly more difficult.
